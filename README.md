# Frappe-Books-GUI-Bank-Statement-Importer
 A simple desktop tool created in Python to import your QIF, OFX, and CSV bank statements directly into your Frappe Books database.

Please note that the tool has only just been developed and hasn't been thoroughly tested. The tool does create a backup automatically, but I'd also suggets making your own manual backup before using it.

Here is a screenshot of the application:
